### Access Control

- **Thread/Reply Creation**: User must be enrolled in the scheme
- **Thread/Reply Update**: Only author can update their own content
- **Thread/Reply Delete**: Author or moderators can delete
- **Pin/Close Thread**: Only moderators (admin or instructor)
- **Mark Accepted Answer**: Only instructors

## Events and Notifications

The module fires the following events:

- `ThreadCreated`: Notifies instructor and enrolled users (if author is instructor)
- `ReplyCreated`: Notifies thread/reply author
- `ThreadPinned`: Notifies all enrolled users
- `ReactionAdded`: Notifies content author

## Models

### Thread

## Database Seeding

To seed sample forum data:

```bash
php artisan module:seed Forums
```

This will create:
- 5 threads per course
- 3-7 replies per thread
- Nested replies
- Reactions on threads and replies

## Testing

Run tests:
```bash
php artisan test --filter=Forums
```

## Performance Considerations

- Full-text search indexes on threads table
- Composite indexes for efficient querying
- Eager loading to prevent N+1 queries
- Pagination with 20 items per page
- Soft deletes for data preservation
